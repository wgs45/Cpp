Write three categories, namely Polygon (polygon), Rectangle (rectangle), and Triangle (triangle). Polygon is an abstract category,

The area of Rectangle (area()) is calculated by multiplying both sides. The area of Triangle (area()) is calculated by multiplying both sides and dividing by two. Please complete the categories of Polygon, Rectangle and Triangle so that the following maip() The code can be executed smoothly, And calculate the area of ppoly1 and ppoly2.

int main {
double a=2.5, b=6;

Rectangle<double> r;
Triangle<double> t;
Polygon<double> *ppolyl = &r;
Polygon<double> *ppoly2 = &t;

poly2 -> setValues (a, b);
cout << poly-â€ºareal) < endl;

return 0;
}
