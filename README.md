## Introduction

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming. It is widely used in software development, game development, real-time systems, and more. This repository contains various projects and code examples to help you learn and improve your C++ programming skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

1. **Basic Programs**
   - Hello World
   - Data Types and Variables
   - Control Structures (if, switch, loops)
   - Functions

2. **Intermediate Programs**
   - Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
   - Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
   - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)

3. **Advanced Projects**
   - File I/O Operations
   - Templates and STL (Standard Template Library)
   - Multithreading and Concurrency

## Setup and Installation

To run the C++ programs in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. We recommend using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any modern IDE like Visual Studio, CLion, or Code::Blocks.

### Installation Steps

1. **GCC on Linux/Mac:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install g++
   ```

2. **GCC on Windows:**
   - Download and install MinGW from [MinGW official site](http://www.mingw.org/).
   - Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your system PATH.

3. **Using an IDE:**
   - Download and install your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion).
   - Follow the IDE-specific setup instructions.

## Usage

To compile and run a C++ program, navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` file and use the following commands:

```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
./outputfile
```

For example:

```sh
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
./hello_world
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new projects that you would like to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Please ensure that your code adheres to the existing code style and includes appropriate comments and documentation.
